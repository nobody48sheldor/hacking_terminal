# hacking-terminal
Hacking terminal is a project that is meant to make easier and more user friendly penetration testing, with shorter and more intuitive commands, and some colors to highlight important information.
## commands
In order to see all the commands, use "help", this will prompt a message like shown :

![help prompt](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/748653688515592332/882786548133797908/Screenshot_from_2021-09-02_02-38-17.png)
As you can see there are a few commands, which are shown in either green (for working), or red (for not yet fully working).

## contribute
The code is open source, and I encourage everyone who finds this project interesting to add some more commands, for either scans or even launching attacks, or send a message to the "target" to help him(or her) to secure his device.

I tried to make the code easy to build on.

## install
In order to install, you have first clone the repository, using :

    git clone https://github.com/nobody48sheldor/hacking_terminal

Then to install all the python requirements (not yet made) using :

    pip3 install -r requirements

Then to install all the programs used on the code (like nmap, netcat, searchsploit...), you can if you are on a debian-based OS, run the module.sh (not yet made), by using :

    sh module.sh

And you are good to go, just run :

    sudo python3 <PATH>/hackinginator
