# Hacking terminal
The main goal of this project is to make easier your penetration tests, and different hacking methods, so that you don't have to write obvious information in the command, while still remaining configurable.
## interface
the interface is a command line terminal such as powershell, git-bash, or kali-linux terminal, but with a lot more colors to make it user friendly, and easy to the eye.
## possibilities
you can use "basics" commands in the terminal such as "cd" "pwd" or "ls" by writing first sys.
## support
Hacking terminal is well supported for Linux and should be runnable for windows, but in both cases, you will may need to install some python modules, and some things that requires packages might not all be installable on windows, but WSL can help.
 ## images
 here are what the terminal looks like currently :
